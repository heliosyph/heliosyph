"Hello, World!"

I'm Amy Giselle and am fascinated by cultures and languages. I grew up in Texas where my dominant language was Spanish, but I soon learned English and French when I moved to Louisiana. I'm interested in learning more, but for now I have shifted to learning languages of another kind...

I first dabbled with C++, then Python, but my language of preference is Java. Recently I have been exposed to HTML and CSS. I am currently teaching myself how to work with React, because I'm very interested in bettering myself for front-end job opportunities. 

I am still pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and expect to graduate Spring 2023.
I'm seeking to work on projects concerning, but not limited to, UX/UI, web development or machine learning.
